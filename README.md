# Gallery

In this project, I've created one gallery with a modal window. On the left side of the page, there are tabs which will open once clicked; when opened, those tabs will show a sequence of images and, to pass the cursor over those thumbnails, will get them clearer; to click on them will spawn a modal window (at the center of screen) and, at the bottom of the page, there will be the "alt" of the clicked image.

P. S.: The project isn't completely done yet.
