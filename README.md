# Gallery

In this project, I've created one gallery with a modal window. On the left side of the page, there are tabs which will open once clicked; when opened, those tabs will show a sequence of images and, to pass the cursor over those thumbnails, will get them clearer; to click on them will spawn a modal window (at the center of screen) and, at the bottom of the page, there will be the "alt" of the clicked image, also, on the right side tab and while the cursor stay over an thumbnail (and not in "modal window mode"), the "alt" of the selected image will appear in the above tab.
